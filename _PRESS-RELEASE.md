There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Sub-Heading ##
Supporting students with disabilities & empowering educators

## Summary ##
<product name> is a tool that helps educators and parents better support students with disabilities by tracking student goals and streamlining the IEP reporting process. Teachers can easily submit updates with images of student while parents can easily view their child's progress and identify areas that need additional support. 

## Problem ##
This app was inspired by the desire to advocate for and empower students in Individualized Educational Programs (IEP). IEPs exist to support students with learning deficiencies, and include specific educational goals formed around the unique profile of each student. IEPs allow teachers to provide appropriate modifications and accommodations to help students make academic and social progress, ultimately putting them on a path to achieving their individual goals. Unfortunately, IEP related feedback isn’t consistent across-the-board and important information often gets lost in the paper trail.

## Solution ##
We have come up with an app that tracks the progress of student goals and allows teachers to easily submit feedback with student sample work. This will streamline the IEP reporting process while providing more accurate information based on student data, which allows stakeholders of students to gain a more holistic understanding of students needs and corresponding academic objectives.

## Quote from You ##
"We kept the needs of students and educators in mind through every step of <product name's> creation. We hope this tool makes it easier for everyone to achieve their goals!" - The <product name's> Team

## How to Get Started ##
Once an IEP team member logs into the app, they can earily search through and view their student(s) relevant information. Updating and adding new data is as easy as clicking a few buttons!
